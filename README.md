<p>These are Excel files for download</p>
<p>HalfOfWealthIsSaving (please keep in mind this was tailored for me, adjust to your liking/predictions)</p>

* The name of the sheets are self-explanatory; if you have questions, you can contact me (info @ my profile)
* 🚗 The first one is savings (first 5 years) based on salary ranges and includes time to save up for a car and then have that payment
* 🏠 Get a downpayment estimate and monthly payment and see how much you pay over time and what you make if you sell
* ▶️ Once you have a house price in mind, the next spreadsheet considers your savings for the 25 following years (salaries adjusted for inflation)
* 🕐 The previous spreadsheet has retirement for savings info; this has your salary if you were to retire at the MTA
* 🗾 The Lexus tab was for my dad to consider other cars if he were to trade back his current car

<p>If you find yourself struggling to navigate this Excel file, keep on the lookout for a webpage on my personal website with the functionality of the file</p>

<p>Workout Plan (I want to focus on calisthenics, you can change to whatever program you want)</p>

* 🥩 The Calorie calculator is self-explanatory and is easy to navigate
* ❔ It might seem pointless to use this and find a calculator online, but the one I use does not show expected fat loss over a course of 12 weeks
* 💪 You might want to gain weight, so just enter your calories as you would for the purpose of losing weight. Please, keep in mind that this was meant to visualize fat loss.
